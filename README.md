# AI-based-Age-and-Gender-Recognition-System

An age and gender recognition system in AI/ML project is designed to automatically determine the age and gender of individuals from digital images or videos. The system uses computer vision techniques to analyze various facial features, such as the shape and size of the face, the position and shape of the eyes, nose and mouth, skin color, and other visual cues to predict an individual's age and gender.

The system is trained using large datasets of images and videos with associated age and gender labels, and uses machine learning algorithms to learn patterns in the data that enable accurate prediction of age and gender. Deep learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are commonly used for this task.

The age and gender recognition system can have many practical applications, including in marketing and advertising, security and surveillance, and medical imaging. For example, it can be used to target specific age and gender groups with relevant marketing campaigns, to monitor access to secure areas based on age and gender, and to assist medical professionals in diagnosing certain medical conditions that may be correlated with age and gender.
